# windows-dark-switch

Dark Mode Switcher for Windows 10 that runs in the system tray.

## Background

I could not find a simple and easy version anywhere that worked for me. So here is my approach to a simple dark/light mode switcher. The inspiration to have it on Windows came from a macOS program called "Dark Switch".

## Usage

Click on the dark-switch icon in the system tray to switch between light and dark color themes.

## Configuration

dark-switch also supports theme files.

1. Create a shortcut to the executable
2. Modify the short cut with the path to the light and dark theme file as arguments.

The switch will then just load the theme files instead of the registry changes.
